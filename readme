Make sure that the server and client are running on the same network, or on the same machine.

Copy the files that need to be shared to the directory where the server is running.

Create a files.txt file in the directory where the client is running, listing the names of the files that need to be downloaded, one for each line.

Start the server:

python3 UDPserver.py 51234

Start the client:

python3 UDPclient.py localhost 51234 files.txt

Once the download is complete, use the md5sum -b* command to check the integrity of the file.
